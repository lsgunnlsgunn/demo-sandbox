The *internet computer* is a network of connected computers that communicate securely and provide processing services to registered users, developers, and other computers. 
If you think of the internet computer as an infrastructure platform, it is similar to a public cloud provider, like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure, or a private cloud managed internally by private organizations. 
Unlike a public or private cloud, however, the internet computer platform is not owned and operated by a single private company. 
Its architecture enables multiple computers to operate like one, very powerful, virtual machine that does not dependent on legacy technologies that are vulnerable to attack. 

The architecture of the internet computer platform consists of four main tiers or layers:

- A peer-to-peer inbound communication and replications layer
- A consensus-based security validation layer
- A message routing and distribution layer
- An execution environment layer

Each layer includes components and services that perform specific tasks to ensure secure communication and network performance across all of the participant nodes in the connected network.
