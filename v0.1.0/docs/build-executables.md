# Build the network executables

If you have copied the GitHUb release directory, downloaded and installed Nix, and can connect to the DFINITY network, you can navigate to the DFINITY Rust source (<code style="background:transparent">rs</code>) directory and build the executables.
If you are a member of the DFINITY engineering team and already have a development environment running, you can skip this section.

To build the <code style="background:transparent">dfinity</code> and <code style="background:transparent">nodemanager</code> executables:

1. Navigate to the DFINITY Rust (<code style="background:transparent">rs</code>) source directory on your local computer.

    <code style="font-weight:bold;">cd rs</code>

1. Build the executables by running the following command:.

    <code style="font-weight:bold;">nix-build --option extra-binary-caches https://nix.dfinity.systems</code>

    You must be connected to the office (non-Guest) WiFi or using VPN to connect to build the executable. If the connection is successful, you should see messages indicating that files are being copied from the remote cache similar to the following:

    <pre style="background:transparent">
    copying path '/nix/store/q2y8ybn2d5ww16ymvzvkq9gqzbpw4m4w-cabal2nix-dfinity' from ...
    copying path '/nix/store/1sy3gvzradrixfq9g2xsimcy2dyzny91-cabal2nix-bls' from ...
    </pre>

    This step typically takes 20 to 30 minutes if you are building the executables for the first time. Subsequent builds are much faster.

1. Verify the build was successful by listing the contents of the result binary (<code style="background:transparent">result/bin</code>) directory generated by the build process:

    <code style="font-weight:bold;">ls -l result/bin</code>

    You should see the following files in the command output:

    <pre style="background:transparent">
